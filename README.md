# Download-Folder-Organizer
A Python script that automatically organizes files in your Downloads folder by moving them into subfolders based on their file extensions.
Libraries used:
1.os - to interact with files
2.shutil - to move files between folders
3.glob - to find files matching specific pattern
4.logging - to log actions performed by the script
I created this script because itâ€™s a practical tool that can help people organize their downloads faster and more efficiently.
